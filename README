cups-manueal-duplex-wrapper is a tool that allows duplex printing even when 
the actual printing driver doesn't support that option.
It acts as a wrapper around the printer that splits the print job into two
jobs.

There still are some limitations and hard-coded defaults, but without having
done a real test I think it should work. Install with 
	make && sudo make install

I learnt how it could work from cups-pdf, and copied quite some ideas from
there.
