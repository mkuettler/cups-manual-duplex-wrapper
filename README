INTRODUCTION

cups-manual-duplex-wrapper is a tool that allows duplex printing even when
the actual printing driver doesn't support that option.
It acts as a wrapper around the printer that splits the print job into two
jobs, one for each side of the paper.

INSTALLATION

To compile and install the printer backend, simply type

$ make && sudo make install

You might want to change some configuration before that, see below.

To set up a virtual printer using this backend you can use

$ sudo lpadmin -p <name> -P extra/manual-duplex-wrapper.ppd -v cmdw:/ -L
"Virtual Printer"

This adds a new printer called <name> to the system.  By itself it isn't all
that usefull, though, because it still needs a real printer to back it.  One
option for that is to add a new printer instance

$ lpoptions -d <name>/<instance> -o cmdw-target-printer=<printer-name>

Here <name> is the name of your duplex-wrapper printer that you passed to
lpadmin.  <printer-name> is the name of a real printer on your system, and
<instance> is an arbitrary name for your new printer instance.  You can now
print to <name>/<instance> and the actual printing will be done by
<printer-name>.  Using this command you can add multiple wrappers for
different real printers.
It is also possible to provide more options to in that line.  If, for
example, you would like to turn on duplex printing by default, you can add
-o sides=two-sided-long-edge (or two-sided-short-edge) to the above line.

If you only ever need the wrapper for one printer you could also modify
src/Makefile before you make && sudo make install, to include the line
DEFOPTS+=-DDEFAULT_PRINTER=<printer-name>
Then you don't need to create a printer instance, and printing to <name>
will automatically use the default printer.

UNINSTALL

To uninstall you should remove all Printers using cmdw from your system, and
then just type sudo make uninstall.

BUGS/LIMITATIONS

There are still a number of missing features, including
 - You can't print only odd or only even pages (option page-set) with this
   printer.
 - You can't print your pages in reverse (option outputorder).
 - The dialog to confirm the second print job is always displayed on display
   :0. I'm not sure if there is a way to handle this better.

There are probably more problems. If you find one, let me know!
